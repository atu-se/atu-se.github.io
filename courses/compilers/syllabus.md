## Instructor Contact Information

## Textbooks

### Required

* Engineering a Compiler - 2nd Edition
* [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)

### Supplemental

* Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools - 2nd Edition

## Course Description

The course  builds on the student's core knowledge of languages, grammars and programming and provides an opportunity to see how these core areas can come together to form an application area.
Also it imparts the knowledge about the following:

*	To learn basic techniques used in compiler construction such as lexical analysis, top-down and bottom-up parsing, context-sensitive analysis, and intermediate code generation.
*	To learn basic data structures used in compiler construction such as abstract syntax trees, symbol tables, three-address code, and stack machines.
*	To learn software tools used in compiler construction such as lexical analyzer generators, and parser generators.

## Course Aims

*	Implementing a small compiler using modern compiler writing tools.
*	Providing the student with skills and knowledge (such as lexical analysis and parsing) which are applicable to a broad range of computer science application areas (such as text editors, information retrieval, etc...).


## Format and Procedures

### Attendance

Attendance is required and will be recorded and submitted to the department office.

### Participation

Student should attend all classes and participate in class discussion.  Outside of class, students should complete assigned reading and other assignments.  Students should follow along with the course website for supplemental instructional materials.

## My Assumptions

Students should have an understanding of material from Formal Languages and Automata Theory and Data Structures and Algorithms courses.  If this is a challenge, students should pursue extra remedial study to prepare them for the material in this class.

## Course Requirements

## Grading Procedures

* 10% Attendance
* 20% Assignments, Homework, Quizes, Labs
* 30% Final
* 40% Other Assessments 

Late assignments will be received reduced credit at the teacher's discretion.


## Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive, or a hard copy.  The only exception to this is assignments that are clearly described as group-work, and the expectations for that group work will be documented for those assignments.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied may receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations may result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## Changes

The instructor reserves the right to make changes to the syllabus, course content, and schedule as the course progresses.
