## Updates

### Week of 9-Jan

* [Assignment 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/8vRP5O2f) has been released.  Please read the instructions carefully, including the README.  You will clone the repository and then push your changes to Github to submit your work.  Begin the assignment early, and you are encouraged to submit multiple times -- don't wait until the deadline to learn how to push changes.  
* By 19-Jan, carefully watch the following videos on Reliable Systems
  *  [Airbus FCS Software and Hardware Redundancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOexjozpBdI)
  *  [Availability and Reliability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C94_arCm-Mw)
